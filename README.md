# AMAZON CLONE

Set up a Rails application for `Amazon`. We will use this application to practice many of the Rails concepts in the upcoming weeks.

- Start the Rails Amazon application without tests and using Postgresql: rails new Amazon_clone
    - Be sure to setup git master and branch prior to advancing. 
- Run your application and make sure to get the welcome page from Rails: rails s
- Build 'home' and 'about' pages for your Amazon application that just display simple text. Build 'nav bar' to link to both pages.
- Build a 'contact us' page for your Amazon application that has a name, email and text area fields. When the user submits, it should just show a "Thank you for contacting us!" message.
